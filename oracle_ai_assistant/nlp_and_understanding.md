This code snippet demonstrates how the Natural Language Processing (NLP) module of the Oracle AI Assistant can process user queries and extract their intent. It utilizes the NLTK library for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. The spaCy library is used for dependency parsing. The Transformers library is used for sentiment analysis.

The `process_user_query` function takes a user query as input and performs the following steps:
1. Tokenization: The query is split into individual words or tokens using the `nltk.word_tokenize` function.
2. Part-of-speech tagging: The tokens are tagged with their respective parts of speech using the `nltk.pos_tag` function.
3. Named entity recognition: The part-of-speech tagged tokens are processed by the `nltk.ne_chunk` function to identify named entities.
4. Dependency parsing: The query is processed by the spaCy NLP model to obtain a parsed representation of the query, which includes information about the syntactic structure and dependencies between words.
5. Sentiment analysis: The query is analyzed for sentiment using the sentiment analysis pipeline from the Transformers library. The sentiment label (positive or negative) is extracted from the analysis results.

You can further extend this code to perform additional processing and analysis on the user query based on the extracted information.

Note: Make sure to download the required NLTK resources and the spaCy English model before running this code.
